cron (3.0pl1-38) stable unstable; urgency=low

  * When upgrading from -36 or -36.1, stop old cron daemon
  in preinst, because the prerm's in those versions doesn't.
  * Follow console message standard.

cron (3.0pl1-37) stable unstable; urgency=medium

  * Corrected postinst,prerm, and postrm scripts -- Installs and
  removes rc.d links, and re-starts cron after install.
  * More fixes from the BSD crew, sent to me by Marek Michalkiewicz: mostly
  checks for null pointers, but also a few Makefile fixes, and at least
  one potential buffer overrun (but I know of no exploits).
  * Left in suidmanager stuff, but corrected default permission to 4755,
  per Debian standards.
  * Added CHANGES file (as /usr/doc/cron/changelog.upstream.gz) to
  distribution. Added upstream README to distribution.
  * Moved files out of ./debian/extra into ./debian because dpkg-source
  cannot deal with createing directories. Hmmph.
  * Removed filereaper reference from standard.daily

cron (3.0pl1-36) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed DEBUG logging about SIGPIPE -- it's generated by every
  child once syslogd has been restarted.

 -- Steve Greenland <stevegr@master.debian.org>  Mon, 2 Dec 1996 01:41:16 -0600

cron (3.0pl1-35) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Converted to new source format
  * Added code in misc.c to catch SIGPIPE and re-open syslog. This
  is all in #if defined(DEBIAN), and should be removed when syslog(3)
  is fixed. Also added -DDEBIAN to build commands in Makefile.
