cron (3.0pl1-53) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Applied OpenBSD patches supplied Topi Miettinen. Big change is
  better handling of timekeeping (in particular, changes to/from daylight
  savings time) (closes:#8499).
  * Redirect stdin, stdout, and stderr to /dev/null.
  (closes:#37189, #23231, #30653).

  * Patch to fix "Reverse DoS": user could send arbitrary options to 
  sendmail via MAILTO variable. Fix by not allowing spaces or leading
  dashes in MAILTO, and run sendmail as user, not root.

cron (3.0pl1-51) unstable; urgency=low

  version of debhelper. (closes:Bug#29683)

 -- Steve Greenland <stevegr@master.debian.org>  Mon, 30 Nov 1998 21:10:00 -0600

cron (3.0pl1-47) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Removed close of {stdin,stdout,stderr}, as it appears that
  some cron users expect it.

Cron (3.0pl1-46) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Incorporated buffer overflow patches. (closes:Bug#26705,Bug#26749)

 -- Steve Greenland <stevegr@master.debian.org>  Sun,  1 Nov 1998 19:10:45 -0600

cron (3.0pl1-45) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Updated README and README.Debian w.r.t. file locations.
  * Updated crontab.1 w.r.t. location of allow and deny files.
  * Fixed problem in postinst when new install (instead of upgrade) 
  (closes:Bug#21426)
  * Smarter algorithm for checking /etc/cron.d for changes, no longer
  spins up laptop disks every minute. Thanks to Alexander "Shurik" 
  Shumakovitch for the fix.
  * Re-did checksecurity to only report NFS/AFS insecure mounts
  instead of running find on them (suggestion from Gregory Stark).

 -- Steve Greenland <stevegr@master.debian.org>  Sun, 26 Apr 1998 13:41:51 -0500

cron (3.0pl1-44) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed standards version reference.
  * Fixed init script "comment", sigh. Let this be a warning to you: NEVER EVER
  change a file with doing a complete test, even if it is "just a comment".
  (closes:Bug#19466,Bug#19492,Bug#19479,Bug#19595,Bug#19725,Bug#19840,
  Bug#19845,Bug19852). Sheesh.

cron (3.0pl1-43) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Removed support for TMPDIR. This is due to the problem it causes
    with emacs -- emacs does different things with it's backup files
    depending on whether or not the file is in /tmp. Emacs probably ought
    to use TMPDIR instead of /tmp in its check. I've opened a "wishlist"
    bug for crontab to support TMPDIR. 
    (closes: Bug#15985)
  * When USE_SIGCHLD is defined, before running user process, set handling 
    for SIGCHLD to SIG_DFL, not SIG_IGN. Despite documentation that the
    default for SIGCHLD is ignore, the behaviour is different.
    (closes:Bug#17564,Bug#9075,Bug#16436,Bug#17814)
  * Moved allow and deny files from /var/spool/cron to /etc/cron.{allow,deny}
    (closes:Bug#14970)
  * filenames in /etc/cron.d must comply with run-parts naming convention -
    alpha-numeric, underscore, or hyphen. This ensures that conffile
    remains (e.g. package.dpkg-dist) files don't get run.
  * removed cronanacron command from /etc/crontab and distribution -- 
    replaced by /etc/cron.d/anacron file (from anacron package, not cron).
  * Documented /etc/cron.d dir in manpage and readme.debian
  * modified checksecurity.conf to not check auto file systems. 
    (closes:Bug#8702)
  * crontab -u `whoami` now works. (closes:Bug#8702)
  * documented CRONTAB_NOHEADER in crontab.1
  * /etc/crontab now uses run-parts(8) --report switch. (closes:Bug#18273)
  * fixed initialization of oact in misc.c. (closes:Bug#17134)
  * converted to use debhelper rather than debmake.
  * changed date format in checksecurity so that we don't get false positives
    after six months. (closes:Bug#19025)
  * remove /etc/cron.{allow,deny} on purge

 -- Steve Greenland <stevegr@master.debian.org>  Mon,  9 Mar 1998 01:31:13 -0600

cron (3.0pl1-42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Read files in /etc/cron.d in addition to /etc/crontab (Bug#16628, 
  Bug#16617)

 -- Steve Greenland <stevegr@master.debian.org>  Sun, 11 Jan 1998 18:32:26 -0600

  (Bug#12315, Bug#13466)
  * Added -DUSE_SIGCHLD to defs, needed for alpha (Bug#12855,Bug#8611). 
  May also fix Bug#9075.
  * Changed check for suidmanager (Bug#9326)
  * Checksecurity no longer checks fat or vfat filesystems (Bug#8845, 
  Bug#13574)
  * Changed spaces in crontab to <TAB>, appearance only (Bug#13369)
  * Removed bashism from standard.daily and checksecurity (Bug#9908,
  Bug#9909)
  * Added CHECKSECURITY_DISABLE flag to checksecurity.conf.
  * Get the changelog names correct (Bug#14618)
  * Correct day-of-month and month ranges in crontab.5 (Bug#15073)

 -- Steve Greenland <stevegr@master.debian.org>  Sun, 23 Nov 1997 22:58:05 -0600

cron (3.0pl1-39) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added configuration variable to eliminate error messages from
    checksecurity's find command 
  * Better integration with anacron: suggest anacron, call anacron
    on a regular basis so that it can keeps it's status up-to-date. New
    file /usr/sbin/cronanacron.
  * Call savelog for /var/adm/btmp from /etc/cron.monthly/standard.

cron (3.0pl1-38) stable unstable; urgency=low

  * When upgrading from -36 or -36.1, stop old cron daemon
  in preinst, because the prerm's in those versions doesn't.
  * Follow console message standard.

 -- Steve Greenland <stevegr@master.debian.org>  Sat, 18 Jan 1997 15:34:42 -0600

cron (3.0pl1-37) stable unstable; urgency=medium

  * Corrected postinst,prerm, and postrm scripts -- Installs and
  removes rc.d links, and re-starts cron after install.
  * More fixes from the BSD crew, sent to me by Marek Michalkiewicz: mostly
  checks for null pointers, but also a few Makefile fixes, and at least
  one potential buffer overrun (but I know of no exploits).
  * Left in suidmanager stuff, but corrected default permission to 4755,
  per Debian standards.
  * Added CHANGES file (as /usr/doc/cron/changelog.upstream.gz) to
  distribution. Added upstream README to distribution.
  * Moved files out of ./debian/extra into ./debian because dpkg-source
  cannot deal with createing directories. Hmmph.
  * Removed filereaper reference from standard.daily

 -- Steve Greenland <stevegr@master.debian.org>  Sun, 5 Jan 1997 18:23:14 -0600

cron (3.0pl1-36.1) stable unstable; urgency=HIGH

cron (3.0pl1-36) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed DEBUG logging about SIGPIPE -- it's generated by every
  child once syslogd has been restarted.

 -- Steve Greenland <stevegr@master.debian.org>  Mon, 2 Dec 1996 01:41:16 -0600

cron (3.0pl1-35) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Converted to new source format
  * Added code in misc.c to catch SIGPIPE and re-open syslog. This
  is all in #if defined(DEBIAN), and should be removed when syslog(3)
  is fixed. Also added -DDEBIAN to build commands in Makefile.
