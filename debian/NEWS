cron (3.0pl1-110) unstable; urgency=low

    In the past, long-running jobs caused certain MTAs to time out,
    resulting in no output being sent. Justin Pryzby's patch to fix this
    has been included. It may be worth to note that Debian's default MTA
    exim was not susceptible to this.

    Tasks generating a lot of output no longer die with when no MTA is
    installed.

    crontab(1) now refuses any crontabs missing a newline before EOF. In
    the past, this has been the source of much confusion -- especially
    because the upstream code supposed to detect this was severely broken.

    cron(8) now recovers from broken symlinks in /etc/cron.d. This fix
    may cause power management issues (disk spin-ups), feedback welcome.

    Christian Kastner came on board as a maintainer.

    The checksecurity script is no longer included with the cron package:
    it now has its own package, "checksecurity". If you liked the
    functionality provided with that script, please install the new
    package.
