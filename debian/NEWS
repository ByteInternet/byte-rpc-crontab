cron (3.0pl1-111) unstable; urgency=low

    Cron will log an error if a cronjob exits with a non-zero value with
    a message similar to this after the syslog message which indicates
    the cronjob that is being run ('CMD'):

    (CRON) error (grandchild #XYZW failed with exit status 1)

    Debian systems upgrading from Lenny to Squeeze (or to later version) might
    find that these systems start to generate these new logs and, if using
    logcheck, might start receiving these entries by email.

    In order to avoid this logs the cron job needs to be fixed to ensure
    that a zero exit value is returned under normal conditions.

    For example, the following cronjob used to run a script if, and only if,
    present and executable:

    test -x /name/of/the/script && /name/of/the/script

    Should be changed to either

    if [ -x /name/of/the/script ]; then /name/of/the/script; fi

    or

    test ! -x /name/of/the/script || /name/of/the/script

    To ensure that the exit value 0 if the script does not exist or
    if the script runs successfully.

cron (3.0pl1-110) unstable; urgency=low

    In the past, long-running jobs caused certain MTAs to time out,
    resulting in no output being sent. Justin Pryzby's patch to fix this
    has been included.

    crontab(1) now refuses any crontabs missing a newline before EOF.

    cron(8) now recovers from broken symlinks in /etc/cron.d. This fix
    may cause power management issues (disk spin-ups), feedback welcome.

cron (3.0pl1-74) unstable; urgency=low

    The checksecurity script is no longer included with the cron package:
    it now has its own package, "checksecurity". If you liked the
    functionality provided with that script, please install the new
    package.
