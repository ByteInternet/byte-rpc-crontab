.TH CHECKSECURITY 8 "2 February 1997" "Debian Linux"
.SH NAME
checksecurity \- check for changes to setuid programs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B checksecurity
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B checksecurity
command scans the mounted files systems (subject to the filter defined
in /etc/checksecurity.conf) and compares the list of setuid programs to the
list created on the previous run. Any changes are printed to standard
output.
.PP
.B checksecurity
is run by 
.B cron
on a daily basis, so typically changes would be mailed to root.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The
.B checksecurity.conf
file defines two configuration variables:
.B CHECKSECURITY_FILTER
and
.BR CHECKSECURITY_NOFINDERRORS .
.PP
The 
.B CHECKSECURITY_FILTER
environment variable which is the argument of 'grep -vE' applied to
the output of the  
.B mount
command. In other words, the value of
.B CHECKSECURITY_FILTER
is a regular expression that removes matching lines from those
file systems that will be scanned. The default value removes
all file systems of type 
.I proc, msdos, sio9660, ncpfs,
and
.I smbfs
file systems, 
.I nfs
and
.I afs
file systems that are mounted with the
.I nodev 
and either
.I noexec
or
.I nosuid 
options, anything mounted on /dev/fd*, and anything mounted
on /mnt.
.PP
The
.B checksecurity.conf
file is sourced from 
.B checksecurity,
so you could do some fairly tricky things to define 
.B CHECKSECURITY_FILTER.
